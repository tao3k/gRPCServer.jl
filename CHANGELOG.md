## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Pluggable HTTP/2 backend architecture via `AbstractHTTP2Backend` abstract type
  and `PureHTTP2Backend` default implementation. The `GRPCServer` constructor
  accepts an `http2_backend` keyword argument to select a backend at construction
  time. The `create_connection(backend)` method is the single extension point
  for implementing future backends (e.g., Nghttp2Wrapper.jl, HTTP.jl). See
  `docs/src/http2-backends.md`.
- New `PureHTTP2.jl` runtime dependency — the externalized HTTP/2 protocol
  implementation (frames, HPACK, streams, flow control, connection management)
- CI pipeline now triggers on `develop` branch pushes (in addition to `main` and PRs)
- ROADMAP.md with planned improvements
- CHANGELOG.md for tracking changes
- SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting policy and security best practices
- `TLSConfig` now accepts `alpn_protocols::Vector{String}` (default `["h2"]`) and
  `handshake_timeout_ns::Int64` keyword arguments
- New internal `TLSTransport`, `NegotiatedConnection`, `TLSHandshakeError`, and
  `TLSHandshakeFailureKind` (submodule-scoped enum) types in `src/tls/transport.jl`
- Real server-side ALPN selection during the TLS handshake via Reseau.jl's
  `SSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb` binding; the negotiated protocol is read back via
  `SSL_get0_alpn_selected` instead of being inferred
- mTLS client certificate verification is now actually enforced when
  `require_client_cert = true` is set, via Reseau's `ClientAuthMode` path
- `reload_tls!` now atomically swaps the active TLS configuration without
  rebinding the listening socket or dropping in-flight handshakes
- New `docs/src/tls.md` operator walkthrough covering setup, ALPN behavior,
  mTLS, certificate reload, and error classification
- New `test/integration/test_tls_interop.jl` that exercises the TLS listener
  with Reseau.TLS, `openssl s_client`, and (when available) `grpcurl` as three
  independent client stacks

### Changed
- Documentation build now runs in strict mode (removed `warnonly` from `docs/make.jl`)
- Updated `devbranch` to `develop` in `docs/make.jl` for Git flow compatibility
- TLS backend switched from OpenSSL.jl to Reseau.jl. `Reseau` is now a
  runtime dependency; `OpenSSL` is no longer a runtime dependency
- Accept loop refactored into `_plain_accept_loop` / `_tls_accept_loop`.
  Handshake failures are classified per `TLSHandshakeFailureKind` (CONFIG_ERROR,
  ALPN_MISMATCH, PEER_CERT_REJECTED, HANDSHAKE_IO_ERROR) and logged with
  distinguishable log lines per SC-008
- `GRPCServer.ssl_context` replaced by `GRPCServer.tls_transport`; `stop!` now
  closes both the plain socket and the TLS transport when present
- HTTP/2 protocol implementation (frames, HPACK, streams, flow control,
  connection management) now delegated to the external `PureHTTP2.jl` package.
  Types `HTTP2Connection`, `HTTP2Stream`, `Frame`, `StreamError`, etc. now
  come from PureHTTP2.jl. All previously exported symbols remain available
  via `gRPCServer.X` for backward compatibility.

### Removed
- Removed `OpenSSL` from runtime `[deps]` and `[compat]` in `Project.toml`
- Removed `src/tls/config.jl` (`create_ssl_context`, `verify_tls_config`,
  `wrap_socket_tls`, `get_peer_certificate`, `close_tls_socket`, `TLSError`) and
  `src/tls/alpn.jl` (`ALPN_PROTOCOLS`, `setup_alpn!`, `get_negotiated_protocol`,
  `verify_http2_negotiated`) — all replaced by `src/tls/transport.jl`
- Removed the "OpenSSL.jl does not currently expose ..." workaround comments
  from the TLS layer; the behavior they described no longer applies
- Removed `src/http2/` directory (~3,100 lines: frames.jl, hpack.jl, stream.jl,
  flow_control.jl, connection.jl) — now provided by PureHTTP2.jl
