# Roadmap

This document outlines planned improvements and missing features for gRPCServer.jl based on the project constitution requirements.

## High Priority

### Server Streaming RPC Support with grpcurl

**Status**: Complete

Server streaming RPC methods now work correctly via grpcurl.

**Completed**:
- [x] Implement server streaming support in HTTP/2 response handling
- [x] Test with 02_hello_stream SayHelloStream example
- [x] Update examples/02_hello_stream/README.md with streaming grpcurl commands

### gRPCClient.jl Integration Tests

**Status**: Complete

Integration tests against [gRPCClient.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/gRPCClient.jl) validate client-server interoperability within the Julia gRPC ecosystem.

**Completed**:
- [x] Add gRPCClient.jl as a test dependency
- [x] Create `test/integration/test_grpcclient.jl`
- [x] Test all RPC patterns (unary, server streaming, client streaming, bidirectional)
- [x] Test error handling and status code propagation
- [x] Test compression negotiation

**Notes**:
- Streaming tests (server, client, bidi) require Julia >= 1.12 and are version-gated
- Unary and error tests run on all Julia versions (1.10+)
- Fixed HTTP/2 ENABLE_PUSH compliance (RFC 9113) discovered during testing
- Metadata/header passing tests deferred to a follow-up

### Full mTLS Client Verification

**Status**: Not Started (blocked on upstream)

OpenSSL.jl does not expose `ssl_set_verify` and `ssl_load_client_ca_file`, so full mTLS client certificate verification is not currently possible.

**Current state**: Client CA can be loaded but verification is not enforced (see `src/tls/config.jl:66-68`).

**Approach**: Contribute missing bindings upstream to [OpenSSL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/OpenSSL.jl) rather than implementing local ccall workarounds.

**Upstream Tasks**:
- [ ] Open issue on OpenSSL.jl requesting mTLS verification support
- [ ] Contribute `SSL_CTX_set_verify` binding to OpenSSL.jl
- [ ] Contribute `SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations` binding to OpenSSL.jl
- [ ] Contribute `SSL_get_verify_result` binding to OpenSSL.jl

**Local Tasks** (after upstream merge):
- [ ] Update gRPCServer.jl to use new OpenSSL.jl bindings
- [ ] Add tests for mTLS with valid/invalid client certificates
- [ ] Update documentation with mTLS configuration examples

**References**:
- [OpenSSL.jl GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/OpenSSL.jl)
- [OpenSSL.jl Issues](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/OpenSSL.jl/issues) (no existing mTLS issue as of 2026-01-15)
- [OpenSSL SSL_CTX_set_verify](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_verify.html)
- [gRPC Authentication Guide](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/)

### Documentation Build Strictness

**Status**: ✅ Complete

The documentation build now runs in strict mode with no `warnonly` exceptions.

**Completed**:
- [x] Verified all exported symbols have docstrings (66 exports, all documented)
- [x] Verified no broken cross-references
- [x] Removed `warnonly` from `docs/make.jl`
- [x] Updated `devbranch` to `develop` for Git flow compatibility

## Medium Priority

### Code Coverage Improvements

**Status**: Ongoing

The constitution recommends >80% code coverage for non-generated code.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review current coverage reports
- [ ] Add tests for uncovered error paths
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases in HTTP/2 frame handling

### Performance Benchmarks

**Status**: ✅ Complete

The constitution requires benchmark comparisons for performance-critical changes.

**Completed**:
- [x] Create benchmark suite using BenchmarkTools.jl
- [x] Benchmark request dispatch latency
- [x] Benchmark streaming throughput
- [x] Benchmark message serialization overhead
- [x] Comparison functionality with color-coded output
- [x] Document baseline performance metrics

**Usage**:
```bash
cd benchmark
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
julia --project benchmarks.jl
julia --project benchmarks.jl --save baseline.json
julia --project benchmarks.jl --compare baseline.json
```

## Low Priority

### Additional Contract Tests

**Status**: Partially Complete (grpcurl done)

Expand contract testing beyond grpcurl to other reference gRPC implementations.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test against official Go gRPC client
- [ ] Test against official Python gRPC client
- [ ] Document interoperability matrix

### TTFX (Time-to-First-Execution) Optimization

**Status**: Partially Complete

The constitution recommends TTFX for basic server startup under 5 seconds.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Measure current TTFX
- [ ] Optimize precompilation workload if needed
- [ ] Document TTFX metrics

## To Be Considered

### Publishing Internal Project Artifacts

**Status**: Under Consideration

Consider making internal development artifacts publicly available for transparency and community contribution.

**Options**:
- [ ] Publish project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
- [ ] Publish specs/ directory with design documents
- [ ] Include `.proto` files in repository (currently in `specs/*/contracts/`)
- [ ] Alternative: Download `.proto` files from upstream [grpc/grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) repository at build time

**References**:
- [gRPC Health Checking Protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md)
- [gRPC Server Reflection](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md)

### Security Audit

**Status**: Under Consideration

A security audit would help identify vulnerabilities in the HTTP/2 and TLS implementations.

**Options**:
- [ ] Apply for free security audit programs (e.g., OSTIF, Linux Foundation)
- [ ] Community security review
- [ ] Document threat model and security considerations
- [x] Add security policy (SECURITY.md)

**Areas of concern**:
- HTTP/2 frame parsing and validation
- HPACK decompression (potential for compression bombs)
- TLS configuration defaults
- Input validation on gRPC messages

## Completed

- [x] Core gRPC server implementation
- [x] All four RPC patterns (unary, server/client/bidi streaming)
- [x] HTTP/2 protocol support with HPACK compression
- [x] TLS/mTLS support
- [x] Health checking service
- [x] Reflection service with file descriptors
- [x] Interceptor framework
- [x] Compression support (gzip, deflate)
- [x] Aqua.jl quality tests
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] Contract tests (grpcurl)
- [x] Documentation with Documenter.jl
- [x] CI/CD pipeline
- [x] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md
- [x] CONTRIBUTORS.md
- [x] Performance benchmarks (BenchmarkTools.jl)
